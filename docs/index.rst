pythonwhat
----------

The ``pythonwhat`` package helps you to write Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) for interactive Python exercises on the DataCamp platform.

- If you are new to teaching on DataCamp, check out https://authoring.datacamp.com.
- If you want to learn what SCTs are and how they work, visit `this article <https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/exercises/technical-details/sct.html>`_ specifically.

This documentation features:

- Articles that gradually expose you to all of ``pythonwhat``'s functionality and best practices.
- A glossary with typical use-cases and corresponding SCT constructs.
- Reference documentation of all actively maintained ``pythonwhat`` functions.

If you are new to writing SCTs for Python exercises, work your way through the articles first.
The glossary is good to get a quick overview of how all functions play together after you have a basic understanding.
The reference docs become useful when you grasp all concepts and want to look up details on how to call certain functions and specify custom feedback messages.
